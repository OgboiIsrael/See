			<p>Blah blah blah PROPERTIES AND FUNCTIONS OF CELLS ( MOVEMENT, GROWTH, REPRODUCTION, ETC)
			Diffusion , osmosis, plasmolysis, heamolysis are  simple physical processes which are of vital importance to the chemical reactions taking place in any system, be it a unicellular organism or a very large and multicellular organism.
			<br>
			Diffusion: This is the movement of gaseous, liquid or solid molecules from a region of higher concentration to a lower concentration, across a concentration gradient. Most of the gases that that move in and out of the plant and animal cell move by means of diffusion on small molecules of dissolve minerals move from a higher concentration in the soil to a place of lower concentration in the root hair.</p>
